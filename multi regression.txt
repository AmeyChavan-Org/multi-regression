A.linear regression
1.in two variable
2. multil linear regression (graph - slope)

B. Multi Regression 
		1. logistic regression - it depends on out comes!(graph - sigmold)
			p(a)=less 0.5 then it is 0 class
			p(a)=more than 0.5 then it is 1 class
	CONDITIONAL PROBABLITIY:- finding the probability depend on certain condition and given info .
			so here if more the information then the more the Accuracy of Y attribute

MARKING FOR EXAM:
		IMPORTING LIB , MOUNT DRIVE, READ DATA = 5 marks 

step 1:
goodness measure:- evaluting something (EX- how will define a studnet is good at study by considering his marks)
			for this we use classification_report, confusion_matrix.[weather the model develop is good or bad]
			use for classification ,clustering and regression (not for aprior and liean).

			Y decide which type of logistic regression we hhave to use (binary or miulti nominal).	
			(note : always y last column madhe nasel ...kadhi tari madhi pn asel)


step 2: divide it into two parts(training and test).
		- similarly like we do in linear regression
random_state=0 //we take this because sample form training same gycha hota ... jr nasel jycha same tr random_state 
		
fit()- it train the model with given data.. so pass x and Y// sir example solve kartana help kartat.
ex-					

predict()- making prediction so only x is pass // sir exam ghetat

to compare the outcome - y_test(model anwser or original answer), y_pred(answer computed by my model).


WHEN WE DONE CLASSIFICATION NOT ONLY ACCURACY IS IMPORTANT BUT OTHER FACTOR ARE ALSO IMPORTANT.

# CONFUSION MATRIX:-


on the bases of this we find accuracy .
so how to find accuracy?
- time = 38 min recording

ACCURACY = TN+TP
	    TN+FN+TP+FP... no. of wrong +no. of correct = total accuracy{2 MARKS QUESTION}

	   = 117+38/117+38+24+13=0.80 (80 %)
		
our model has higher accuracy at negative prediction(90%)but less at positive (covid +) ..so it is problamatical
conclusion:- NOT ONLY ACCURACY IS IMPORTANT BUT OTHER FACTOR ARE ALSO IMPORTANT
